**Problems** - Some time we have write some logic in many components, also in fetching data we have to fetch in eatch componets if we  do'nt pass props
 
 **Solution** - A higher order components (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing components logic . HOC is a function that takes a components and return a                   new components.
